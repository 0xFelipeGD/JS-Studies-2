/**
 * Medical Office Queue System
 *
 * A JavaScript program that simulates a waiting queue management system for a medical office.
 * The system provides an interactive menu interface to manage patient queues with the following functionality:
 *
 * Features:
 * - Display current queue with patient positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
 * - Add new patients to the end of the queue
 * - Remove and consult the first patient in line
 * - Interactive menu system that continues until explicitly terminated
 *
 * Menu Options:
 * - "New patient": Prompts for patient name and adds them to the end of the queue
 * - "Consult patient": Removes the first patient from queue and displays their name
 * - "Exit": Terminates the program
 *
 * The program maintains a continuous loop, returning to the main menu after each action
 * (except exit), ensuring efficient queue management throughout the medical office's operations.
